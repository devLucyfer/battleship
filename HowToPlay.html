    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
        This is a guessing game that is divided into <strong>cells</strong> and <strong>columns</strong>. Alphabet (A â€“ G) represents the column and number (0-6) represents the row.
    </p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
        At the right-bottom corner, there is an input box that accepts your input. Your job is to provide the two characters (for example B3) of which the first character is the alphabet from A to G (All in Caps) and a second character is a number from 0 to 6 into the input box. Your input will target the cell (combined with these two characters) to reveal its hidden value.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game consists of 9 ships hidden behind these cells. You need to find or hit those ships in the minimum guess possible. When all the ships are found the game is over.

        All right then, happy playing.
